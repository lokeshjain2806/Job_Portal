        <p class="lead">
    <p>A job portal, often referred to as a job board or online job platform, is a digital platform designed to connect job seekers with potential employers. These platforms have revolutionized the job search and recruitment process by providing a convenient and efficient way for job seekers to find job opportunities and for employers to identify and attract qualified candidates.</p>

    <p>Here are some key points about job portals:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Job Search and Listing:</strong> Job portals serve as a central hub where employers can post job openings, and job seekers can search for relevant positions. These listings are typically categorized by industry, location, job type, and other relevant criteria.</li>

        <li><strong>Resume Submission:</strong> Job seekers can create and submit their resumes on these platforms, making it easier for employers to find potential candidates. Many job portals also offer resume-building tools to help individuals create professional resumes.</li>

        <li><strong>Filtering and Matching:</strong> These platforms use algorithms and search filters to match job seekers with job listings that closely align with their skills, experience, and preferences. This saves time for both parties.</li>

        <li><strong>Notifications and Alerts:</strong> Job seekers can set up email alerts or notifications for new job postings that match their criteria. Employers can also receive alerts when suitable candidates apply for their positions.</li>

        <li><strong>User Profiles:</strong> Job portals often include user profiles where job seekers can showcase their skills, experience, education, and achievements. Employers can review these profiles to assess a candidate's qualifications.</li>

        <li><strong>Application Process:</strong> Job seekers can apply for jobs directly through the portal, which usually involves submitting a resume and cover letter. Some portals also facilitate the application process through one-click apply features.</li>

        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Job portals may include messaging systems for communication between job seekers and employers. This feature streamlines the interview scheduling and candidate selection process.</li>

        <li><strong>Salary Information:</strong> Some job portals provide salary information for specific roles, helping job seekers and employers understand market rates and make more informed decisions.</li>

        <li><strong>Additional Resources:</strong> Many job portals offer articles, blog posts, and resources to help job seekers improve their job search skills, create better resumes, and excel in interviews.</li>

        <li><strong>Global Reach:</strong> Job portals have a global reach, making them accessible to job seekers and employers worldwide. This can be especially useful for companies seeking international talent and job seekers looking for opportunities abroad.</li>

        <li><strong>Paid vs. Free Services:</strong> While many job portals offer free services to job seekers, some offer premium features for an additional fee. Employers often pay to have their job listings featured or to access a larger pool of applicants.</li>

        <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Job portals typically offer mobile applications to allow users to search for jobs and apply on the go.</li>
    </ol>
